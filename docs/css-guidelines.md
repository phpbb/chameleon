## Introduction

CSS is not a pretty language. While it is simple to learn and get started with,
it soon becomes problematic at any reasonable scale. There isn’t much we can do
to change how CSS works, but we can make changes to the way we author and
structure it.

There are a variety of techniques we must employ in order to satisfy these
goals, and CSS Guidelines is a document of recommendations and approaches that
will help us to do so.

The first part of this will deal with syntax, formatting and CSS anatomy, the
second part will deal with approach, mindframe and attitude toward writing and
architecting CSS.


## Syntax and Formatting

One of the simplest forms of a styleguide is a set of rules regarding syntax and
formatting. Having a standard way of writing (literally writing) CSS means that
code will always look and feel familiar to all members of the team.

Further, code that looks clean feels clean. It is a much nicer environment to
work in, and prompts other team members to maintain the standard of cleanliness
that they found. Ugly code sets a bad precedent.

The chosen code format must ensure that code is: easy to read; easy to clearly
comment; minimizes the chance of accidentally introducing errors; and results in
useful diffs and blames.

At a very high-level, we want

- Tab (4 space width) indents;
- 80 character wide columns;
- multi-line CSS;
- a meaningful use of comments & whitespace.


### Anatomy of a Ruleset

Before we discuss how we write out our rulesets, let’s first familiarize
ourselves with the relevant terminology:

The following is a `[ruleset]`
```css
[selector],
[selector] {
	[property]: [value]; |
	[property]: [value]; | <- [declaration-block]
	[property]: [value]; |
	[<--declaration--->]
}
```


### Formating

- Use one discrete selector per line in multi-selector rulesets.
- The opening brace (`{`) should be on the same line as our last selector.
- Include a single space before the opening brace (`{`).
- Include properties and values on the same line.
- Include one declaration per line in a declaration block.
- Use one level of indentation for each declaration.
- Include a single space after the colon (`:`) of a declaration.
- Use lowercase hex values, e.g., #abc123.
- Use quotes consistently. **Preference double quotes**, e.g., `content: ""`.
- Always quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., `input[type="checkbox"]`.
- Avoid specifying units for zero-values, e.g., `margin: 0`.
- Always use leading zeros, e.g, `font-size: 0.875rem`
- Include a space after each comma(`,`) in comma-separated property or function values.
- Include a semi-colon(`;`) at the end of every declaration including the last in a declaration block.
- Place the closing brace (`}`) of a ruleset in the same column as the first character of the ruleset, on its own line.
- Separate each ruleset by a blank line.

Example:

```scss
.selector-1,
.selector-2,
.selector-3[type="text"] {
    -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    display: block;
	padding: 0;
    font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
    color: #333333;
    background: #ffffff;
    background: linear-gradient(#ffffff, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8));
}

.selector-a,
.selector-b {
    padding: 10px;
}
```

This format seems to be the largely universal standard (except for variations in
indentation).

As such, the following would be incorrect:

```scss
.foo, .foo-bar, .baz
{
  display:block;
  background-color:green;
  color:red }
```

Problems here include

- 2 spaces instead of tabs (4 space width).
- selectors on the same line.
- the opening brace (`{`) on its own line.
- the closing brace (`}`) does not sit on its own line.
- the last semi-colon (`;`) is missing.
- no spaces after colons (`:`).


### Multi-line CSS

CSS should be written across multiple lines, except in very specific
circumstances. There are a number of benefits to this:

- A reduced chance of merge conflicts, because each piece of functionality exists on its own line.
- More ‘truthful’ and reliable `diffs`, because one line only ever carries one change.

Exceptions to this rule should be fairly apparent, such as similar rulesets
that only carry one declaration each, for example:

```css
.icon {
	display: inline-block;
	width: 16px;
	height: 16px;
	background-image: url(/img/sprite.svg);
}

.icon-home     { background-position: 0 0; }
.icon-person   { background-position: -16px 0; }
.icon-files    { background-position: 0 -16px; }
.icon-settings { background-position: -16px -16px; }
```

These types of ruleset benefit from being single-lined because

- they still conform to the one-reason-to-change-per-line rule;
- they share enough similarities that they don’t need to be read as thoroughly as other rulesets—there is more benefit in being able to scan their selectors, which are of more interest to us in these cases.


### Declaration order

declarations are to be consistently ordered by related property declarations
following the order

1. Typographic
2. Visual
3. Positioning
4. Box model
5. Misc

Example:

```scss
.declaration-order {
	/* Typography */
	font: normal 13px "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
	line-height: 1.5;
	text-align: center;

	/* Visual */
	background-color: #f5f5f5;
	border: 1px solid #e5e5e5;
	border-radius: 3px;
	color: #333333;

	/* Positioning */
	position: absolute;
	z-index: 100;
	top: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	left: 0;

	/* Box-model */
	display: block;
	float: right;
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 8px;

	/* Misc */
	content: "-";
}
```


### Proper Use of units

CSS allows for the use of several different unit types. As such it can get
confusing when using more than one type of unit through out the project. For
that reason its beneficial to stick to a stick set of rules for what unit types
are to be used for certain selectors.

Furthermore there are certain reasons to use or avoid using specific units in
certain places.

#### EM
The 'em' unit. This is a very problematic unit which reeks havoc on countless
projects due to the way its calculated. As such this unit type must be avoid
except for very very minimal use cases. We prevent the use of `em` except for
`letter-spaceing` & `word-spacing`. It is also used for icon sizing but that is
an edge case.

#### Line-heights
All line-heights are to be specified as `unitless` in order to prevent in proper
inheritance. By nature when using units with line-heights the children inherit
by default. This can lead to unwanted effects and bloated code. A `sass`
function called `unitless` is provided which will convert px values for
convenience, but for clarity the math is simply

```scss
	line-height: (desired px value) / (current elements font-size)
```

#### Font-size
All `font-size` should be specified either in `px` or `%` in small cases. All px
values will be converted to `rem` during the build process as `rem` provide for
control in responsive situations.

#### Margins & Paddings
All `margin` & `padding` should be specified in `px` values or `%`. All `px` All
px values will be converted to `rem` during the build process as `rem` provide
for control in responsive situations.

#### PX
All `px` will be whole numbers. Browsers do not render `px` in fractional values
despite what you browser may say it is. Only calculated values will display as
fractional `px`. For clarification a calculated value would be units like `rem`,
`em`, `%`, & even `unitless` as is the case with line-heights.

#### Dimensions
All dimensional values `width`, `min-width`, `height`, & `min-height` should be
specified in `px` or `%`. A case can be made for `vw` & `vh`, but they are still
on the fringe of browser acceptance, as such fallbacks in `px` or `%` are
required. These values will remain as px if specified. This is done as `height`
is more effectively and appropriately controlled via the `line-height` property,
and `width` is better specified using the objects box-model via `padding` unless
its fluid in which `100%` can be specified or u can also use
`left: 0; right: 0;`



#### Indenting Sass

Sass provides nesting functionality. That is to say, by writing this:

```css
.foo {
	color: red;

	.bar {
	    color: blue;
	}
}
```

…we will be left with this compiled CSS:

```css
.foo { color: red; }
.foo .bar { color: blue; }
```

When indenting Sass, we stick to the same two indentation, and we also leave a
blank line before and after the nested ruleset.

**N.B.** Nesting in Sass should be avoided in most cases. See [the Specificity section](#/codeing-guidelines?id=specificity) for more details.


### Enforcing standardisation

Our project makes use of several tools to lint and to keep us to the standards.

#### 1. [stylelint.io](http://www.stylelint.io)
?> This is used to provide detailed linting for our standards via the `.stlyelintrc` file in the root of the project.

#### 2. [postcss-sorting](https://github.com/hudochenkov/postcss-sorting)
?> This is used to provide automatic sorting to our declaration order via the `.postcss-sorting.json` file in the root of the project.

#### 3. [postcss-pxtorem](https://github.com/cuth/postcss-pxtorem)
?> This is used to ensure the proper units are consistently used throughout the project during the build process via the `gulp` as well as on save in your editor.

#### 4. [stylefmt](https://github.com/morishitter/stylefmt)
?> This is used to help automatically re-format your code to the standards on the fly during the build process via `gulp` as well as on save in your editor.
