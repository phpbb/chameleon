## CSS Selectors

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, one of the most fundamental, critical aspects of
writing maintainable and scalable CSS is selectors. Their specificity, their
portability, and their reusability all have a direct impact on the mileage we
will get out of our CSS, and the headaches it might bring us.

### Selector Intent

It is important when writing CSS that we scope our selectors correctly, and that
we’re selecting the right things for the right reasons. Selector Intent is the
process of deciding and defining what you want to style and how you will go
about selecting it. For example, if you are wanting to style your website’s main
navigation menu, a selector like this would be incredibly unwise:

```css
header ul { }
```

This selector’s intent is to style any `ul` inside any `header` element, whereas
our intent was to style the site’s main navigation. This is poor Selector
Intent: you can have any number of `header` elements on a page, and they in
turn can house any number of `uls`, so a selector like this runs the risk of
applying very specific styling to a very wide number of elements. This will
result in having to write more CSS to undo the greedy nature of such a selector.

A better approach would be a selector like:

```css
.site-nav { }
```

An unambiguous, explicit selector with good Selector Intent. We are explicitly
selecting the right thing for exactly the right reason.

Poor Selector Intent is one of the biggest reasons for headaches on CSS
projects. Writing rules that are far too greedy—and that apply very specific
treatments via very far reaching selectors—causes unexpected side effects and
leads to very tangled stylesheets, with selectors overstepping their intentions
and impacting and interfering with otherwise unrelated rulesets.

CSS cannot be encapsulated, it is inherently leaky, but we can mitigate some of
these effects by not writing such globally-operating selectors: **your selectors should be as explicit and well reasoned as your reason for wanting to select something.**

### Reusability

With a move toward a more component-based approach to constructing UIs, the idea
of reusability is paramount. We want the option to be able to move, recycle,
duplicate, and syndicate components across our projects.

To this end, we make heavy use of classes. IDs, as well as being hugely
over-specific, cannot be used more than once on any given page, whereas classes
can be reused an infinite amount of times. Everything you choose, from the type
of selector to its name, should lend itself toward being reused.

### Location Independence

Given the ever-changing nature of most UI projects, and the move to more
component-based architectures, it is in our interests not to style things based
on where they are, but on what they are. That is to say, our components’ styling
should not be reliant upon where we place them—they should remain entirely
location independent.

Let’s take an example of a call-to-action button that we have chosen to style
via the following selector:

```css
.promo a { }
```

Not only does this have poor Selector Intent—it will greedily style any and
every link inside of a `.promo` to look like a button—it is also pretty wasteful
as a result of being so locationally dependent: we can’t reuse that button with
its correct styling outside of `.promo` because it is explicitly tied to that
location. A far better selector would have been:

```css
.btn { }
```

This single class can be reused anywhere outside of `.promo` and will always
carry its correct styling. As a result of a better selector, this piece of UI is
more portable, more recyclable, doesn’t have any dependencies, and has much
better Selector Intent. **A component shouldn’t have to live in a certain place
to look a certain way.**

### Portability

Reducing, or, ideally, removing, location dependence means that we can move
components around our markup more freely, but how about improving our ability to
move classes around components? On a much lower level, there are changes we can
make to our selectors that make the selectors themselves—as opposed to the
components they create—more portable. Take the following example:

```css
input.btn { }
```

This is a _qualified_ selector; the leading `input` ties this ruleset to only
being able to work on `input` elements. By omitting this qualification, we allow
ourselves to reuse the `.btn` class on any element we choose, like an `a`, for
example, or a `button`.

Qualified selectors do not lend themselves well to being reused, and every
selector we write should be authored with reuse in mind.

Of course, there are times when you may want to legitimately qualify a
selector—you might need to apply some very specific styling to a particular
element when it carries a certain class, for example:

```css
/**
 * Embolden and color any element with a class of `.error`.
 */
.error {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}

/**
 * If the element is a `div`, also give it some box-like styling.
 */
div.error {
	padding: 10px;
	border: 1px solid;
}
```

This is one example where a qualified selector might be justifiable, but I would
still recommend an approach more like:

```css
/**
 * Text-level errors.
 */
.error-text {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}

/**
 * Elements that contain errors.
 */
.error-box {
	padding: 10px;
	border: 1px solid;
}
```

This means that we can apply `.error-box` to any element, and not just a
`div`—it is more reusable than a qualified selector.

#### Quasi-Qualified Selectors

One thing that qualified selectors can be useful for is signaling where a class
might be expected or intended to be used, for example:

```css
ul.nav { }
```

Here we can see that the `.nav` class is meant to be used on a `ul` element, and
not on a `nav`. By using _quasi-qualified selectors_ we can still provide that
information without actually qualifying the selector:

```css
/*ul*/.nav { }
```

By commenting out the leading element, we can still leave it to be read, but
avoid qualifying and increasing the specificity of the selector.

### Naming

As Phil Karlton once said
> 'There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.'

I won’t comment on the former claim here, but the latter has plagued me for
years. My advice with regard to naming things in CSS is to pick a name that is
sensible, but somewhat ambiguous: aim for high reusability. For example, instead
of a class like `.site-nav`, choose something like `.primary-nav`; rather than
`.footer-links`, favor a class like `.sub-links`.

The differences in these names is that the first of each two examples is tied to
a very specific use case: they can only be used as the site’s navigation or the
footer’s links respectively. By using slightly more ambiguous names, we can
increase our ability to reuse these components in different circumstances.

To quote Nicolas Gallagher:

> Tying your class name semantics tightly to the nature of the content has already reduced the ability of your architecture to scale or be easily put to use by other developers.

That is to say, we should use sensible names—classes like `.border` or `.red`
are never advisable—but we should avoid using classes which describe the exact
nature of the content and/or its use cases. **Using a class name to describe
content is redundant because content describes itself.**

The debate surrounding semantics has raged for years, but it is important that
we adopt a more pragmatic, sensible approach to naming things in order to work
more efficiently and effectively. Instead of focussing on ‘semantics’, look more
closely at sensibility and longevity—choose names based on ease of maintenance,
not for their perceived meaning.

Name things for people; they’re the only things that actually read your classes
(everything else merely matches them). Once again, it is better to strive for
reusable, recyclable classes rather than writing for specific use cases. Let’s
take an example:

```css
/**
 * Runs the risk of becoming out of date; not very maintainable.
 */
.blue { color: blue; }

/**
 * Depends on location in order to be rendered properly.
 */
.header span { color: blue; }

/**
 * Too specific; limits our ability to reuse.
 */
.header-color { color: blue; }

/**
 * Nicely abstracted, very portable, doesn’t risk becoming out of date.
 */
.highlight-color { color: blue; }
```

It is important to strike a balance between names that do not literally describe
the style that the class brings, but also ones that do not explicitly describe
specific use cases. Instead of `.home-page-panel`, choose `.masthead`; instead
of `.site-nav`, favor `.primary-nav`; instead of `.btn-login`, opt for
`.btn-primary`.


### Selector Performance

A topic which is—with the quality of today’s browsers—more interesting than it
is important, is selector performance. That is to say, how quickly a browser
can match the selectors your write in CSS up with the nodes it finds in the DOM.

Generally speaking, the longer a selector is (i.e. the more component parts)
the slower it is, for example:

```css
body.home div.header ul { }
```

…is a far less efficient selector than:

```css
.primary-nav { }
```

This is because browsers read CSS selectors right-to-left. A browser will read
the first selector as

- find all `ul` elements in the DOM;
- now check if they live anywhere inside an element with a class of `.header`;
- next check that `.header` class exists on a `div` element;
- now check that that all lives anywhere inside any elements with a class of `.home`;
- finally, check that `.home` exists on a `body` element.

The second, in contrast, is simply a case of the browser reading find all the elements with a class of `.primary-nav`.

To further compound the problem, we are using descendant selectors (e.g.
`.foo .bar {}`). The upshot of this is that a browser is required to start with
the rightmost part of the selector (i.e. `.bar`) and keep looking up the DOM
indefinitely until it finds the next part (i.e. `.foo`). This could mean
stepping up the DOM dozens of times until a match is found.

This is just one reason why
**nesting with preprocessors is often a false economy**; as well as making
selectors unnecessarily more specific, and creating location dependency, it
also creates more work for the browser.

By using a child selector (e.g. `.foo > .bar {}`) we can make the process much
more efficient, because this only requires the browser to look one level higher
in the DOM, and it will stop regardless of whether or not it found a match.

#### The Key Selector

Because browsers read selectors right-to-left, the rightmost selector is often
critical in defining a selector’s performance: this is called the key selector.

The following selector might appear to be highly performant at first glance. It
uses an ID which is nice and fast, and there can only ever be one on a page, so
surely this will be a nice and speedy lookup—just find that one ID and then
style everything inside of it:

```css
#foo * { }
```

The problem with this selector is that the key selector (`*`) is very, very far
reaching. What this selector actually does is find every single node in the DOM
(even `<title>`, `<link>`, and `<head>` elements; everything) and then looks to
see if it lives anywhere at any level within #foo. This is a very, very
expensive selector, and should most likely be avoided or rewritten.

Thankfully, by writing selectors with good
[Selector Intent](#/codeing-guidelines?id=selector-intent), we are probably
avoiding inefficient selectors by default; we are very unlikely to have greedy
key selectors if we’re targeting the right things for the right reason.

That said, however, CSS selector performance should be fairly low on your list
of things to optimize; browsers are fast, and are only ever getting faster, and
it is only on notable edge cases that inefficient selectors would be likely to
pose a problem.

As well as their own specific issues, nesting, qualifying, and poor Selector
Intent all contribute to less efficient selectors.

### General Rules

Your selectors are fundamental to writing good CSS. To very briefly sum up the
above sections:

- **Select what you want explicitly**, rather than relying on circumstance or coincidence. Good Selector Intent will rein in the reach and leak of your styles.
- **Write selectors for reusability**, so that you can work more efficiently and reduce waste and repetition.
- **Do not nest selectors unnecessarily**, because this will increase specificity and affect where else you can use your styles.
- **Do not qualify selectors unnecessarily**, as this will impact the number of different elements you can apply styles to.
- **Keep selectors as short as possible**, in order to keep specificity down and performance up.

Focussing on these points will keep your selectors a lot more sane and easy to
work with on changing and long-running projects.
