## CODENAME: Chameleon

## What is it?
A new theme being developed to replace prosilver going forward for the phpBB platform. It is meant to be forward thinking, easily maintainable and endlessly scaleable yet still be very customizable. Checkout the [Development Topic](https://area51.phpbb.com/docs/dev/development/index.html) on phpBB.com or open a disscussion on area51 in the [Style Development](https://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=131&sid=719d3d0bbf257d54cbe43d1dfb4fb8c2) forum for more detailed information.

## Guidelines
We are using very strict [Coding Guidlines](https://area51.phpbb.com/docs/dev/development/index.html) now to help ensure everything stays maintainable and easy to use. They are being enforce via [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and [xo](https://github.com/xojs/xo)

## Dependencies
 - This project relies on the new [Base-L](https://github.com/hanakin/base-l) front-end framework being built along side of the theme.
 - We are using [Gulpjs](https://gulpjs.com/) as our build tool
 - The templates are being rendered via [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) which is a js port of Django the python template engine that Twig is based on so our Twig syntak is nearly indentical (Anyone willing to help develop plugins/extensions for this to help get it closer to the phpBB imlimentation is extremely welcome)
